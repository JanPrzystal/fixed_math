This project implements fixed point numbers in Rust.  
The struct Number represents a mixed number without the use of float type.  
The main function prints out predefined example numbers and math operations done on them and later waits for the user to input a number. After it is provided the program converts it to a fixed point number and prints in various formats.  
To stop the program type 'e' instead of a number.  
The precision for the fraction part is set to 8 bits but can be adjusted in code.
